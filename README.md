## Pokédex (Project requirement at CareerFoundry)

This is a Javascript app, where I use an external API to get 150 pokémons from the list. With this link you can go directly to the site: https://darkpfeffer.github.io/Pokedex/ . Or you can start 'index.html' if you have the files locally.


### How to use the site:

You can click the buttons to see the pokémon's height and an image of it. The modal window can be closed by clicking on the 'Close' button, clicking outside the window, or pressing 'Escape'.

With the use of the search bar, you can search for a specific pokémon. Write in the name (or just a part of it), then press 'Enter' or click the 'Search' button. If you want to have all the pokémons again, clear the search bar (by pressing 'Escape' or the 'X' button) and press 'Enter' or the 'Search' button again.

### Tools I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- UI Framework: 
    * Bootstrap
- API: https://pokeapi.co/ , https://getbootstrap.com/
