## Pokédex (Project requirement at CareerFoundry)

This is a Javascript app, where I use an external API to get 150 pokémons from the list. With this link you can go directly to the site: https://darkpfeffer.github.io/Pokedex/ . Or you can start 'index.html', if you have the files locally. 

### How to use the site:

You can click on the buttons to see the pomémon's height and an image of it. The modal window can be closed by clicking on the 'Close' button, clicking outside the  window or pressing 'Escape'. 

With the use of searchbar you can search for a specific pokémon. Write in the name (or just a part of it), then press 'Enter' or click on the 'Search' button. If you would like to have all the pokémons again, then clear the search bar (with pressing 'Escape' or the 'X' button) and press 'Enter' or the 'Search' button again.

### Used resources:

Syntaxes: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Framework: Bootstrap
